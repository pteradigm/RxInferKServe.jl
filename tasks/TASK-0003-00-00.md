**Status**: [ ] In Progress
**Created**: 2025-01-08
**Updated**: 2025-01-08
**Assignee**: Claude Code
**Priority**: P1 (High)
**Parent Task**: N/A
**Dependencies**: TASK-0002-00-00
**Estimated Effort**: M (1d)

## User Story
As a RxInferKServe maintainer,
I want automated CI/CD pipelines with semantic versioning,
So that releases are automated and Docker images are published to GitHub Container Registry.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [x] No existing GitHub Actions workflows
- [x] Docker configuration exists in `docker/` directory
- [x] Project version managed in Project.toml (currently 0.1.0)
- [x] Comprehensive Makefile for build tasks

### Technical Research
- [x] GitHub Actions best practices for Julia projects
- [x] Semantic release with conventional commits
- [x] Multi-architecture Docker builds
- [x] GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) integration

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [x] CI workflow runs tests on Julia 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, and nightly
- [x] Code coverage reports to Codecov
- [x] Semantic versioning based on conventional commits
- [x] Docker images published to ghcr.io/pteradigm/rxinferkserve
- [x] Documentation deployed to GitHub Pages
- [ ] All workflows pass successfully on PR

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [x] Workflows follow GitHub Actions best practices
- [x] Security scanning for Docker images
- [x] Proper secrets management
- [x] Efficient caching for dependencies

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Workflow Creation âœ“
1. [x] Create `.github/workflows/` directory structure
2. [x] Implement CI workflow (`ci.yml`) for testing and coverage
3. [x] Implement release workflow (`release.yml`) with semantic versioning
4. [x] Implement Docker workflow (`docker.yml`) for container builds
5. [x] Implement documentation workflow (`docs.yml`)
6. [x] Add Dependabot configuration

### Phase 2: Documentation Updates âœ“
1. [x] Add CI/CD badges to README.md
2. [x] Document CI/CD process in README.md
3. [x] Create comprehensive documentation structure
4. [x] Add PR and issue templates

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
1. [ ] Create feature branch for testing
2. [ ] Push changes and create PR
3. [ ] Monitor workflow execution
4. [ ] Fix any CI/CD issues
5. [ ] Verify all checks pass

## Workflows Implemented

### 1. CI Workflow (`ci.yml`)
- Matrix testing across Julia versions and OS
- System image building and testing
- Code coverage with Codecov
- Code formatting checks with JuliaFormatter

### 2. Release Workflow (`release.yml`)
- Semantic release with conventional commits
- Automatic version bumping in Project.toml
- GitHub release creation with changelog
- Docker image building on release
- Julia package registration

### 3. Docker Workflow (`docker.yml`)
- Multi-architecture builds (amd64, arm64)
- Push to GitHub Container Registry
- Vulnerability scanning with Trivy
- Caching for faster builds

### 4. Documentation Workflow (`docs.yml`)
- Build documentation with Documenter.jl
- Deploy to GitHub Pages
- Run on main branch and tags

## Configuration Details

### Semantic Release Configuration
- feat: Minor version bump
- fix: Patch version bump
- BREAKING CHANGE: Major version bump
- docs, chore, test: No version bump

### Docker Registry
- Registry: ghcr.io
- Image: pteradigm/rxinferkserve
- Tags: latest, v1.2.3, v1.2, v1

## Test Plan

### Workflow Testing
- [ ] CI workflow runs on PR
- [ ] Tests pass on all Julia versions
- [ ] Coverage reports generated
- [ ] Docker builds succeed
- [ ] Documentation builds without errors

### Release Testing
- [ ] Conventional commit triggers release
- [ ] Version bumped correctly
- [ ] Docker image published
- [ ] GitHub release created

## Current Status

### Completed:
- âœ… All workflow files created
- âœ… Documentation updated with badges and CI/CD info
- âœ… PR and issue templates added
- âœ… Dependabot configuration
- âœ… Documentation structure created
- âœ… Docker model mounting support added
- âœ… CI/CD fixes implemented

### In Progress:
- ðŸ”„ Testing workflows with actual PR
- ðŸ”„ Monitoring CI/CD execution
- ðŸ”„ Fixing remaining test failures

## Known Issues Fixed
- âœ… UUID in Project.toml was placeholder (fixed to proper UUID)
- âœ… Author email was incorrect (fixed to rbellamy@pteradigm.com) 
- âœ… Repository URL references updated to pteradigm organization
- âœ… Dockerfile updated to Julia 1.11 base image
- âœ… Health check endpoint fixed to use v2 protocol
- âœ… Function name fixed from run_server to start_server
- âœ… Manifest.toml added to version control for reproducible builds
- âœ… JuliaFormatter CI step fixed to use temporary environment

## Remaining Issues
- Julia 1.9 tests failing (likely compatibility issue)
- Need to investigate other test failures

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All workflows execute successfully
- [ ] Tests pass on all platforms
- [ ] Docker images build and push
- [ ] Documentation deploys
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Semantic versioning works correctly

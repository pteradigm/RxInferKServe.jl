# Success Indicators for Infinite Stream Demo

## Quick Success Check

The demo is running successfully if you see ALL of the following:

### 1. Server Started Successfully ✓
```
[Server Output]
Starting RxInferKServe with streaming models...
Streaming models registered successfully!
Server listening on:
  HTTP: http://0.0.0.0:8080
  gRPC: 0.0.0.0:8081
Server is ready for streaming inference!
```

### 2. Client Connected Successfully ✓
```
[Client Output]
Waiting for server to be ready...
Server is live!
Model streaming_kalman is ready!
Model online_ar_learning is ready!
Model adaptive_mixture is ready!
```

### 3. All Three Models Processing Data ✓

You should see continuous output from all three models:

#### Kalman Filter (every ~0.1s):
```
Processed 10 samples. Latest estimate: 1.234, Latest observation: 1.256
Processed 10 samples. Latest estimate: 1.445, Latest observation: 1.467
Processed 10 samples. Latest estimate: 1.678, Latest observation: 1.690
```
**Success**: Estimates are tracking observations with small differences

#### AR Parameter Learning (every ~0.2s):
```
Processed 5 samples. Parameters: α=0.012, β=0.798
Processed 5 samples. Parameters: α=0.015, β=0.802
Processed 5 samples. Parameters: α=0.018, β=0.795
```
**Success**: Parameters are updating and β stays near 0.8 (expected AR coefficient)

#### Mixture Model (every ~0.5s):
```
Processed 20 samples. Regime distribution: {0: 5, 1: 12, 2: 3}, Weights: ['0.25', '0.60', '0.15']
Processed 20 samples. Regime distribution: {0: 8, 1: 10, 2: 2}, Weights: ['0.40', '0.50', '0.10']
Processed 20 samples. Regime distribution: {0: 3, 1: 15, 2: 2}, Weights: ['0.15', '0.75', '0.10']
```
**Success**: All 3 regimes detected (0, 1, 2) and weights sum to ~1.0

## Detailed Success Metrics

### Performance Indicators
- **Latency**: Each inference completes in < 100ms
- **Throughput**: Processing 100+ samples/second across all models
- **Memory**: Stable memory usage (no continuous growth)

### Data Quality Indicators
- **Kalman Filter**: RMSE between estimates and observations < 0.5
- **AR Model**: Parameter variance stabilizes after ~100 samples
- **Mixture Model**: Correctly identifies regime switches

## Common Failure Patterns

### ❌ Server Failed to Start
```
ERROR: Failed to bind to port 8080: Address already in use
```
**Fix**: Kill process using port or change port in docker-compose.yml (used with podman-compose)

### ❌ gRPC Connection Failed
```
gRPC error: StatusCode.UNAVAILABLE: failed to connect to all addresses
```
**Fix**: Check server is running and ports are exposed

### ❌ Model Not Ready
```
Waiting for model streaming_kalman to be ready...
[Repeats indefinitely]
```
**Fix**: Check server logs for model registration errors

### ❌ No Data Processing
```
Starting Kalman filter streaming...
[No further output]
```
**Fix**: Check gRPC connectivity and server health

## Visual Success (if display available)

If running with display, you'll see:
1. **Top plot**: Blue dots (observations) with red line (Kalman estimates) closely following
2. **Middle plot**: Green line showing AR process with visible but stable variations
3. **Bottom plot**: Colored scatter plot with clear clustering in 3 regimes

## Automated Success Check

Run the test script for automated validation:
```bash
./test_demo.sh
```

Expected output:
```
✓ Server is live
✓ Model streaming_kalman is ready
✓ Model online_ar_learning is ready
✓ Model adaptive_mixture is ready
✓ Kalman filter inference successful
✓ AR model inference successful
✓ Mixture model inference successful

All tests passed!
Demo test completed successfully!
```

## Log Files

Check logs for detailed diagnostics:
```bash
# Server logs
podman-compose logs rxinfer-server

# Client logs  
podman-compose logs streaming-client

# Combined logs with timestamps
podman-compose logs -f --timestamps
```

## Success Summary

You know the demo is working when:
1. ✓ No error messages in logs
2. ✓ Continuous data processing output from all 3 models
3. ✓ Reasonable parameter values (not NaN or Inf)
4. ✓ Stable performance over time (runs for minutes without issues)
5. ✓ Graceful shutdown on Ctrl+C

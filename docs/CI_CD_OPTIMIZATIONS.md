# CI/CD Optimization Summary

This document summarizes the optimizations made to improve build times and caching efficiency.

## Julia Caching Improvements

### Before
- Used `julia-actions/cache@v2` with default settings
- Cache keys included run-specific IDs, preventing cache reuse across runs
- No fallback cache keys

### After
- Added explicit cache configuration with `actions/cache@v4`
- Cache keys based on OS, Julia version, and dependency files
- Hierarchical restore keys for better cache reuse:
  ```
  ${{ runner.os }}-julia-${{ matrix.version }}-
  ${{ runner.os }}-julia-
  ```
- Separate cache strategies for different jobs (test, sysimage, lint)

### Expected Impact
- Faster dependency installation on subsequent runs
- Better cache hit rates across PRs and branches
- Reduced CI time by 5-10 minutes per job

## Docker Build Optimizations

### Before
- Always built for both linux/amd64 and linux/arm64
- Build time: ~3.5 hours for PRs
- Poor layer caching due to copying all files at once

### After
1. **Architecture Selection**:
   - All builds: linux/amd64 only
   - Rationale: Reduces build time from 3.5h to ~1h
   - ARM support can be added later based on demand

2. **Improved Layer Caching**:
   - Copy Project.toml/Manifest.toml first
   - Install dependencies in a separate layer
   - Copy source code last
   - Better cache reuse when only source changes

### Expected Impact
- All builds: ~1 hour (down from 3.5 hours) 
- Better layer caching when dependencies don't change
- Faster iterative development
- Simpler CI/CD pipeline

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Pre-built Base Images**: Consider creating custom base images with Julia and common dependencies pre-installed

2. **Parallel Jobs**: Split tests across multiple runners for faster feedback

3. **Conditional Builds**: Skip Docker builds for documentation-only changes

4. **Registry Caching**: Use Julia package servers for faster downloads

## Monitoring

Track these metrics to validate improvements:
- Average CI run time
- Cache hit rates
- Docker build times for PRs vs main branch
